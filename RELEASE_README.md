## Quick Start

1. Open **HTMLtoEXE.exe**
2. Click **Existing Project** → **Browse Folder** → select your project folder
3. Fill in the project name
4. Go to **Build System** → select your project → click **Start Building**

## Notes

- **Antivirus warning:** Some antivirus programs may flag the app. This is a false positive common with PyInstaller-built apps. Click "Allow" or add an exception.
- **First launch may be slow** — the app extracts files on first run. Subsequent launches are faster.
- The generated `.exe` files work on any Windows 10/11 PC without Python or any other software installed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| App won't open | Right-click → Run as Administrator |
| Antivirus blocks it | Add an exception in your antivirus settings |
| Build fails | Ensure your project folder has an `index.html` (HTML) or `.py` file (Python) |
| Generated EXE won't run | Rebuild with "Hide console" unchecked to see error messages |

**Just download, run, and convert — no setup needed.**
